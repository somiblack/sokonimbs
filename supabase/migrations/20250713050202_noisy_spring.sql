  # Fix RLS policies for transaction inserts

  1. Policy Changes
    - Drop all existing policies to avoid conflicts
    - Create new insert policy that allows server-side operations
    - Recreate select policy for user data access
    - Add update policy for application callbacks

  2. Security
    - Maintains RLS protection
    - Allows server-side inserts using anon key
    - Users can only read their own transactions
    - Application can update transaction status

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own transactions" ON transactions;
