  # Fix transaction insert policy

  1. Security Updates
    - Add policy to allow application inserts for transactions
    - Ensure server-side operations can create transactions
    - Maintain security while allowing necessary operations

  2. Changes
    - Create new policy for application inserts that works with anon key
    - Keep existing policies for user data access
*/

-- Drop the existing restrictive insert policy if it exists
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Application can insert transactions" ON transactions;

-- Create a new policy that allows inserts for authenticated and anon users
-- This is needed for server-side operations using the anon key
CREATE POLICY "Allow application inserts"
  ON transactions
  FOR INSERT
  TO public
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Ensure the existing select policy remains for user data access
-- Users can only read transactions where they are payer or recipient
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own transactions" 
  ON transactions 
  FOR SELECT 
  TO public
  USING (
    (payer_phone = current_setting('app.current_user_phone'::text, true)) OR 
    (recipient_phone = current_setting('app.current_user_phone'::text, true))
  );

-- Keep the update policy for application use
CREATE POLICY "Allow application updates"
  ON transactions
  FOR UPDATE
  TO public
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
